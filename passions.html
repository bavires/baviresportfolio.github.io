  <p>The following is a list of my personal interests and goals / What I like to do in my free time.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; I like to play the guitar and record down tracks and riffs in ableton during my free time</p>
  <p>&nbsp; I have always had an interest in the way computers work. I have always enjoyed messing around with the more technical things. Like vmware for example.</p>
